# SM64RomhackSRC

This is my SRC codebase for SM64 romhacks.
This was done in pythong 3.10, these additional installs are needed.
If you are writing runs to SRC you will need a .env file with a SRC_API_KEY, you can get that key from https://www.speedrun.com/<YOUR_USER_HERE>/settings/api

pip install requests
pip install pandas
pip install python-dotenv
pip install openpyxl
